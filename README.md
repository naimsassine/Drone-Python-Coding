# Drone-Python-Coding
I've always been interested in how drones could be programmed and used in different situations, so I took a drone coding course in Python and in this repo are a bunch of scripts that I wrote learning from this course.

You can find [here](https://youtu.be/LmEcyQnfpDA) the link to the course I followed on drone programming with python.
A very interesting course given by the Computer Vision Zone.

Here is a quick overview of the different files : 
- Connect_and_Fly.py : just the first basic steps to connect to the drone and make it fly using only code
- Keys_Command.py : a first introduction to using the keyboard keys in order to move the drone
- Stream_On.py : the necessary code in order to turn on the drone camera and watch the stream on your PC
- Surveillance.py : go beyond just watching the static camera, but fully watch and control the drone through your PC
- Mapping.py : draw a map on your PC that will represent the drone current live movement in space
- Line_Follower.py : let the drone follow a specific line
- Face_Tracking.py : detect a face using the drone's camera and follow it
